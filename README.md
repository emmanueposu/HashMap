Here is my implementation of a HashMap in two forms, first using separate chaining and again via open 
addressing with quadratic probing. A dynamic array is used to store the hash table for both 
implementations. Chaining for collision resolution is implemented using a singly linked list. Open 
addressing with quadratic probing for collision resolution is implemented inside a dynamic array.
